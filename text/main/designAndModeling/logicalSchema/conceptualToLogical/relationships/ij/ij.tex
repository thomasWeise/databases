The single-table realization of an \crowsFoot{I}{M1}{J}{M1} conceptual relationship.%
}%
%
We have the two entity types~I and~J.
Each entity of type~I must be linked to exactly one entity of type~J.
Each entity of type~J must be linked to exactly one entity of type~I.

In this scenario, we only need a single table~\cite{S2024D:MEDTRDM}.
We just merge the attributes of the two entity types and put them all into one table.
If each pair of related entities of types~I and~J forms a single row in table~\sqlil{i_j}, then there can never be any issue with the referential integrity.
Neither can we have a row without the I~entity, nor can we have a row without entity of type~J.
This is illustrated in \cref{lst:IJ_tables}.%
