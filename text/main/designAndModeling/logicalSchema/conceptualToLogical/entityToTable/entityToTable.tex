\hsection{Entities to Tables}%
\label{sec:mappingEntitiesToTables}%
%
Each entity type in the conceptual model becomes one table in the logical model.
Each simple single-valued attribute becomes one column of that table.
Each component of a composite attribute becomes one column of that table.
Multi-valued attributes come separate tables, where each row references the primary key of entity's table as foreign key.
Derived attributes are not included in the table.%
