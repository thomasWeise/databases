\hsection{Summary}%
%
At this stage, we now have the means to translate conceptual models to logical models that follow the relational principle.
In \glsreset{rdb}\pglspl{rdb}, all the data is stored in tables.
Each table as a primary key.
One table can refer to another table via columns that can store the primary keys of that other table.
These columns then are called the foreign keys.
The referential integrity between the tables is maintained via \sqlilIdx{REFERENCES}, \sqlilIdx{NOT NULL}, and \sqlilIdx{UNIQUE} constraints.
We have learned how to map weak entities, relationship attributes, derived attributes, and relationships of higher degrees to this data model as well.
With this, we have the tools to transform all the elements that can draw into a \glsreset{ERD}\pgls{ERD} to \sql\ code.%
