\hsection{Example: Room Management System}%
%
If a table is normalized to the \pgls{2NF}, then all attributes depend on the entire primary key.
This only matters if the primary key is composite, i.e., if it consists of multiple columns.
If a table violates the \pgls{2NF}, then this means that some columns are functionally dependent only on a part of but not the whole primary key.

Let us explore why this can be a bad thing.
Back in \dref{fig:erdRoom1}, we presented an \pgls{ERD} for the room planning subsystem of our teaching management platform.
We will now create two implementations that try to realize a part of such a system.
The first one will violate the \pgls{2NF} and the second one will not.%
