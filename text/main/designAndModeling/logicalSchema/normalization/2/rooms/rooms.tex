\hsection{Example: Room Management System}%
%
If a table is normalized to the \pgls{2NF}, then all attributes depend on the entire primary key.
This only matters if the primary key is composite, i.e., if it consists of multiple columns.
Let's assume that the primary key is the only key.
If a table violates the \pgls{2NF}, then this means that some columns are functionally dependent only on a part of but not the whole primary key.

Let us explore why this can be a bad thing.
Back in \dref{fig:erdRoom1}, we presented an \pgls{ERD} for the room planning subsystem of our teaching management platform.
We will now create two implementations that try to realize a part of such a system.
The first one will violate the \pgls{2NF} and the second one will not.%
