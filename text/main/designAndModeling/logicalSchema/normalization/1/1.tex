The \glsreset{1NF}\pgls{1NF} dates back to \citeauthor{C1970ARMODFLSDB}'s seminal paper~\cite{C1970ARMODFLSDB}.
Under the \pgls{1NF}, all rows in a table must have the same number of fields.
This excludes multi-valued attributes as well as composite attributes.
As we already discussed before the relational data model does not support such attributes anyway.

In \cref{sec:mappingEntitiesToTables}, we discussed how entity types in the conceptual schema are translate to tables in the logical schema based on the requirements of the relational data model.
We stated that multi-valued attributes become separate tables and that composite attributes need to be recursively broken down into their atomic components, which then become separate columns.
If we use the relational data model, then we would naturally produce logical models in \pgls{1NF}.%
