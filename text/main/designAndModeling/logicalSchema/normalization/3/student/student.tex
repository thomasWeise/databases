\hsection{Example:~Student and Parent Information}%
%
Imagine that during the design of the teaching management platform, a colleague mentions that it would be a good idea to also have the contact information of one parent stored for each student.
Sometimes there can be situations where such information could be useful.
Maybe a student has an accident on campus.
Maybe a student suddenly stops coming to lectures and is nowhere to be found.
Then it would be good to be able to call a parent.%
