\hsection{The Relational Data Model}%
\label{sec:relationalModel}%
%
In the \pglspl{ERD} that we painted \emph{before} \cref{sec:compactCrowsFootNotation}, there were three visual components:
entity types~(rectangles), attributes~(ellipses), and relationship types~(diamonds).
When we moved to the more compact visualization style in \cref{sec:compactCrowsFootNotation}, the relationship diamonds disappeared.
Instead, they were represented just by straight lines.
This has two reasons:
First, the relationship diamonds waste space.
Second, in the relational data model, relationships do not exist as independent objects.
In this model, we only have entity types~(embodied by tables) and attributes~(the columns of the tables).
Relationships are realized as foreign keys, i.e., as special attributes.%
