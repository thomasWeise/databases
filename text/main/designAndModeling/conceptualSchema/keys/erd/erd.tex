While we feel very pessimistic about our idea about the concept of students, for now, we bravely march on and update our \pgls{ERD} from \cref{fig:erdStudent4}.
In the new \cref{fig:erdStudent5}, the attribute \emph{Student-ID} is marked as primary key.
This is done by underlining the attribute name~\cite{G2011EW2ITDS:CMUTERM}.%
