Let us now begin with the conceptual modelling of applications.
The requirements analysis has provided us with an understanding of the entities in our szenario and the relationships between them.
In the case of our example, we know the entities of the teaching management platform and how they interact.
However, so far, we discussed them only very informally.
It is now time to put the information about the entities together into consistent models.
At the conceptual design step, these models will be independent from any concrete technology.
This step is called \emph{entity relationship modeling}~\cite{G2011EW2ITDS:CMUTERM,SS2005EIDDDFDB:CDDRAAML,SS2005EIDDDFDB:CDDICAMP,V1999C5DMS:CDUTERM,B1990CMERMO}.

It should be noted that creating such models makes a lot of sense for larger \db\ applications like our example here.
However, there are also many possible smaller situations where we may want to use a \db, say, to manage our literature reference, to manage a collection of books or musical records.
For such smaller projects, one may directly skip this step and move on to the logical model~\cite{S2024D:CDMERDE}.
Either way, we are now working on a beautiful and big project, so we definitely want to take this step.
