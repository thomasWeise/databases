Creating the table \textil{product} to store the products we produce and sell.%
}%
%
So let us create the table~\sqlil{product}.
There are two ways for doing this:
We can either start a \psql\ session and type in the necessary commands one by one, which is illustrated in \cref{fig:createTableProduct:A}%.
Or we can send a \sql\ script with all the commands to the \postgresql\ server directly via \psql.
The script that we would use for this is shown in \cref{lst:factory:create_table_product} and its output is given in \cref{exec:factory:create_table_product}.
For the last time in this book, we will discuss both methods side-by-side and afterwards, we will only work with the script-based approach.

If we chose the manual step-by-step method, then we first start a new \psql\ session in \cref{fig:createTable1psql}.
This time we do this as user~\sqlil{boss} with password~\sql{superboss123}.
This user is the owner of our \db\ \sqlil{factory} and has the right to create tables and insert data.

We can create a new table using the command \sql{CREATE TABLE}\sqlIdx{CREATE!TABLE}\sqlIdx{TABLE}, followed by the table name, followed by the attributes that we want to store~\cite{PGDG:PD:CT2}.
We typed this command in \cref{fig:createTable3command}.
As you can see, this is a bit cumbersome, because the command is long.
Writing it as a script and then sending this to the \postgresql\ \dbms\ is more convenient, which is why we will prefer this method later on.
Anyway, the command is a bit long, because it contains the whole description of the data that we will store in the table later.

For example, each product must have a name.
The names could be long or short, but 100~characters per product should suffice.
\sql\ provides the datatype \sqlilIdx{VARCHAR}, which refers to a variable-length string, whose maximum length is specified in parentheses~\cite{PGDG:PD:CT}.
We could thus choose \sqlil{VARCHAR(100)}\sqlIdx{VARCHAR} for the column \sqlil{name} for our table~\pythonil{product}.
We thus write~\sqlil{name VARCHAR(100)}\sqlIdx{VARCHAR} when defining this column.
The names must also be unique.
We can never have two different products with the same name.
So we add the keyword~\sqlil{UNIQUE}~\cite{PGDG:PD:C}.
If, later, someone tries to enter a record into our table whose \sqlil{name} value already exists in another record, then this will fail with an error.
We also want to enforce that every single record indeed has a \sqlil{name} value set.
There must never be any row in the table without a properly set name.
Therefore, we add the \sqlilIdx{NOT NULL} specification and write \sqlil{name VARCHAR(100)\ UNIQUE NOT NULL}\sqlIdx{VARCHAR}\sqlIdx{NOT NULL}\sqlIdx{UNIQUE}~\cite{PGDG:PD:C}.
Nice, we just defined our very first own column.

Additionally, we should store the price at which we sell the product.
The price is clearly a number.
Computers usually provide two fundamental types of numbers on the hardware level, integer numbers and floating point numbers~(a subset of~\realNumbers).
These types also exist in many programming languages.
\python~\cite{programmingWithPython}, for example, offers us the two very basic datatypes \pythonilIdx{int} and \pythonilIdx{float} corresponding to integers and floating point numbers, respectively.
Which one should we use?
Now prices naturally are values with fractions, something like \$99.99 or 17.75元, so at first glance, the \sql\ equivalent of \python's \pythonilIdx{float} seems a reasonable choice here.
However, it is actually not, because in \cite{programmingWithPython}, we write:%
%
\bestPractice{floatImprecise}{%
Always assume that any \pythonilIdx{float} value is imprecise. %
Never expect it to be exact~\cite{PTVF2007NRTAOSC:EAAS,BHK2006CNFCMEARFCS:NS,programmingWithPython}.%
}%
%
\begin{sloppypar}%
Indeed, using double precision IEEE~Standard 754 floating point numbers~\cite{IEEE2019ISFFPA,H1997IS7FPN}, the expression~\pythonil{0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3} may yield~\pythonil{5.551115123125783e-17} as result.
Thus, if we stored~0.3元 as a price in our \db\ using floating point numbers and a customer transferred three times~一毛钱, then the bank may encounter problems if we want to transfer $5.551115123125783*10^{-17}$元 back as change\dots
\end{sloppypar}%
%
\bestPractice{moneyNotFloat}{%
Never represent monetary data with floating point numbers~\cite{SE:SO:WNUDOFTRC,W2020HSISCVISS}.%
}%
%
We could use integer numbers representing the number of cents instead, but then we would always need to use some arithmetics to properly display prices, which also creates a potential for errors~\cite{W2020HSISCVISS}.
Actually neither integers nor floating point numbers are the right choice!
Instead, we will use the datatype~\sqlilIdx{DECIMAL}, which can represent a fractional number with a pre-defined number of digits exactly.
Writing \sqlil{price DECIMAL(10, 2)} allows us to store values with 10~digits, 2~of these 10~digits are after the comma~\cite{PGDG:PD:NT}.
This means that we can store values between -99\decSep999\decSep999.99 and~99\decSep999\decSep999.99.
This should be enough for prices of products in our shoe and handbag factory.
Of course, each product must have a price, so we add again the \sqlilIdx{NOT NULL} keyword.%
%
\bestPractice{moneyDecimal}{%
Store monetary data using the \sqlilIdx{DECIMAL} datatype~\cite{C2024SCVDTCBP,W2020HSISCVISS}.%
}%
%
We will sell each product in a box.
Therefore, we also want to store the width, height, and depth as well as the weight of the packaged box.
For the height, width, and depth, we will use millimeter as unit and for the weight we use grams.
We can store values using the datatype \sqlilIdx{INT}, which is a shorthand for \sqlilIdx{INTEGER} and can hold values from -2\decSep147\decSep483\decSep648 to +2\decSep147\decSep483\decSep647.
Each product must have values specified for all four dimensions, so we again mark them as~\sqlilIdx{NOT NULL}.

Tables in a \db\ do not exist in an isolated manner.
Instead, they will reference each other.
For example, later we will create a table where we store which customer bought which product.
For this, we will need at least three tables:
A table of customers~(which we do not yet have), the table of products (that we are creating right now), and a table for the customer orders.
Each record in that last table will reference one row in the customers table and one row in the products table.

For allowing the latter, we need a unique way to identify each row in our table.
Now our table already has a column with unique values, namely~\sqlil{name}.
However, these are of type \sqlilIdx{VARCHAR}, i.e., they are potentially long strings.
This would mean that each record in the orders table would also need to store the long \sqlil{name} string.
This would probably be inefficient~\cite{SE:DA:2014VPKM}.
Also, maybe later we have many other records referencing a certain product by its name {\dots} but the marketing department chooses to change the name of the product.
This could wreak havoc to our \db.
It is better to use an automatically generated unique value as key that will never change even if we change the name of a product~\cite{B2025DS:SBPASG}.%
%
\begin{sloppypar}%
We therefore add another column that we are going to call~\sqlil{id}, which should hold a unique integer value.
We define it as \sqlil{id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY}\sqlIdx{INT}\sqlIdx{GENERATED}\sqlIdx{BY DEFAULT}\sqlIdx{PRIMARY KEY}\sqlIdx{IDENTITY}.
The \sqlil{GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY}\sqlIdx{GENERATED{\idxdots}AS IDENTITY}~\cite{PGDG:PD:IC,PGDG:PD:GC} means that we do not need to specify values for this column when storing data.
The system will automatically choose the next integer value that was not yet used.
Here, \sqlIdx{GENERATED{\idxdots}AS IDENTITY!BY DEFAULT}\sqlil{BY DEFAULT} tell the system that we \emph{can} specify values for \sqlil{id} if we want to, which then take precedence over the generated values.
This could be useful if we want to keep the values of \sqlil{id} if backup parts of the table elsewhere and then want to reinsert them.
Alternatively, we could also have written \sqlIdx{GENERATED{\idxdots}AS IDENTITY!ALWAYS}\sqlil{ALWAYS}, in which case the \sqlil{id} values will always be generated automatically.
We will use this column as the so called \sqlilIdx{PRIMARY KEY}, i.e., as the value that should be used by other tables to reference rows in our \sqlil{product} table.
The annotation with \sqlilIdx{PRIMARY KEY} also automatically enforces that only unique values can be stored.%
\end{sloppypar}%
%
\bestPractice{surrogatePrimaryKey}{%
Prefer using surrogate primary keys based on automatically incremented integers~\cite{B2025DS:SBPASG}. %
See also \cref{def:surrogateKey}.%
}%
%
\bestPractice{primaryKeyId}{%
Whenever using an automatically incremented integer as primary key for a table, name it~\sqlil{id}. %
While there is some controversy about this topic~\cite{SE:SE:WINATPKCICBPC}, anybody accessing your \db\ will immediately understand the meaning of the \sqlil{id}~columns and this practice is used in many sources~\cite{B2025DS:SBPASG,PGDG:PD}.%
}%
%
This completes the \sql\ command for creating our very first table.
If we had typed it into the \psql\ console, then it would succeed and print \sqlil{CREATE TABLE} back to us, as shown in \cref{fig:createTable4created}.

If instead we had written the command into a script, then we would also fire up \psql\ again.
Since the \db\ belongs to the user \sqlil{boss}, we now log in as \sqlil{boss} using their password \sqlil{superboss123}.
We also want to work on the \db\ \sqlil{factory}.
The \postgresql\ connection \pgls{URI} for the \db\ \pgls{server} running on our current computer~(identified by \localhost) and therefore is \textil{postgres://boss:superboss123@localhost/factory}.
Assume that the script with the command was stored in a file called \bashil{create_table_product.sql}, then we would write \bashil{ -ebf create_table_product.sql} after the connection \pgls{URI} parameter of \psql.
\Cref{exec:factory:create_table_product} shows what happens if we execute the script \cref{lst:factory:create_table_product} this way.

Well, actually the script contains more commands:
We also want to check whether the commands worked correctly.
Before creating the new table, we thus print the list of tables owned by user \sqlil{boss}.
All of them are stored in table \sqlilIdx{pg\_catalog.pg\_tables} in the \postgresql\ \pgls{server}.
We only print the table names, which are in column~\sqlilIdx{tablename}.
We only want to see those owned by \sqlil{boss}, so we add the statement \sqlil{WHERE tableowner = 'boss'}.
The name of the user owning each table is stored in column \sqlilIdx{tableowner}, and only if it equals \sqlil{boss}, we print the table name.%
%
\begin{sloppypar}%
This results in the query \sqlil{SELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables}\sqlIdx{SELECT{\idxdots}FROM} with the clause \sqlil{WHERE tableowner = 'boss';}\sqlIdx{WHERE}~\cite{PGDG:PD:SC:S}.
As you can see, before executing the \sqlil{CREATE TABLE}\sqlIdx{CREATE!TABLE}\sqlIdx{TABLE} command, this query returns nothing.
Afterwards, one new table exists, namely~\sqlil{product}.
This output is also illustrated in \cref{fig:createTable5select,fig:createTable6selected}.%
