\hsection{The Table \inQuotes{customer}}%%
\label{sec:factory:table:customer}%
Next, we design a table for managing customer data.
The kind of customer data that we want to play with here is mostly textual.
This gives us a chance to play with some more advanced text-related features of \pglspl{db}.
At the same time, we will learn more methods to constrain the valid ranges for the data in columns.%
