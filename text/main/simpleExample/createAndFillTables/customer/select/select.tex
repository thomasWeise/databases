Obtaining information from our new table~\sqlil{customer}.%
}{}%

Let us complete this exercise by extracting some data from the new table~\sqlil{customer} in \cref{lst:factory:select_from_table_customer}.
First, we want to have a list of all customers from France.
This can be done with the query \sqlil{SELECT name, address FROM customer WHERE address LIKE '\%France\%';}\sqlIdx{LIKE}\sqlIdx{WHERE}\sqlIdx{SELECT{\idxdots}FROM}
The query prints the \sqlil{name} and \sqlil{address} of all customers whose \sqlil{address} field contains, somewhere, the text~\textil{France}.

Next, we want to know how many domestic Chinese customers we have and how many customers purchase our products from abroad, i.e., not from China.
We first need to decide whether a customer is based in China or not.
We can do this by \sqlil{address ILIKE '\%china\%' as domestic}\sqlIdx{ILIKE}.
Notice that we this time wrote \sqlilIdx{ILIKE} instead of \sqlilIdx{LIKE}.
\sqlilIdx{ILIKE} works basically the same as \sqlilIdx{LIKE}, with the exception that it compares text case-insensitive.
For \sqlilIdx{LIKE}, \textil{China} and \textil{china} are two different strings.
For \sqlilIdx{ILIKE}, they are the same.
By writing \sqlil{SELECT address ILIKE '\%china\%' as domestic from customer;}, we would get a one-column result which contains the value \sqlilIdx{TRUE} for every customer from China and \sqlilIdx{FALSE} for every customer from abroad.%
%
\begin{sloppypar}%
We can now divide the customers into groups based on this column \sqlil{domestic} by adding \sqlil{GROUP BY domestic}\sqlIdx{GROUP BY} to the query.
We count the number of customers in each group by also selecting the new value \sqlil{COUNT(*)}\sqlIdx{COUNT}.
\sqlil{COUNT(*)}\sqlIdx{COUNT} counts the rows in the current group and returns the result as integer number.
The complete query is \sqlil{SELECT COUNT(*), address ILIKE '\%china\%' as domestic FROM customer GROUP BY domestic;}.
It produces two rows.
The first row has \sqlil{domestic} as \sqlil{f}, which means \sqlilIdx{FALSE}.
In its \sqlil{count} column, we see the value~3.
The second row has \sqlil{domestic} as \sqlil{t}, which means \sqlilIdx{TRUE}.
In its \sqlil{count} column, we see the value~1.
Indeed, there are three foreign customers and one domestic one in our \db.%
\end{sloppypar}%

If you looked at this example carefully, then you noticed that the method of deciding whether a customer is from China or not, as well as the method of detecting french customers, are not very precise.
For example, if a customer would have specified their country as 中国, i.e., China written in Chinese, we would have considered them a foreigner.
Then again, if the director of the imaginary \emph{Donut Factory Vive la France} in Shanghai would order shoes from us, we would consider his address to be french and domestic at the same time.\footnote{%
This situation arises because we here violate the \glsreset{1NF}\pgls{1NF}, which we will discuss much much later, in \cref{sec:normalForm:1}. %
Indeed, dividing the \sqlil{address} column into multiple columns would be part of the solution.}
Maybe we should have had another column \sqlil{country}?
In this case, we would most likely need a table with countries and link that table to our \sqlil{customer} table\dots
Next, we will explore how tables can be \inQuotes{linked} together.%
