Using \sql\ to create a the user \textil{boss} with password \textil{superboss123}.%
}%

For the sake of simplicity, assume that we are locally logged in the \db~\server\ computer and that the password to the administrator user \textil{postgres} is set to~\textil{XXX}.
As illustrated in \cref{fig:psqlNewUser1starting}, we first open a \pgls{terminal}~(console).
This can be done via \ubuntuTerminal\ under \ubuntu\ \linux, while under \microsoftWindows, you need to \windowsTerminal.
We want to start the \client\ program \psql\ with the proper connection \pgls{URI}~\cite{PGDG:PD:CU} to access our \postgresql\ \server.%
%
\usefulTool{psql}{%
\psql\ is a text-based console program that can be used to connect to a \postgresql\ \pgls{server}. %
From the \psql\ console, we can send \sql\ commands to the \postgresql\ \pgls{server} and receive its answers.%
}%
%
We can connect to the \postgresql\ \server\ on our local machine by providing the connection \pgls{URI} \textil{postgres://postgres:XXX@localhost}.
This \pgls{URI} is constructed as follows~\cite{PGDG:PD:CU}:%
%
\begin{itemize}%
%
\item The \textil{postgress://} tells \psql\ that this is, indeed, a connection \pgls{URI}.
%
\item The second occurrence of \textil{postgres} is actually the user name.
As you may remember from the installation, the administrator user for the whole \postgresql\ \server\ has the name \textil{postgres}.%
%
\item The colon~\inQuotes{\textil{:}} separates the user name from the password~\textil{XXX}.
Of course, you should not actually use a password like~\textil{XXX}.
Please replace it with a password you deem reasonable.
Let me stress again:
Never use something like \textil{XXX} as a password.
I am also not doing that.
For the examples in the book, I just replaced the actual password with \textil{XXX}.
%
\item After an \inQuotes{@} comes the network address or host name where the \postgresql\ \server\ is running.
We write \glsreset{localhost}\localhost, which stands for the current machine itself.
It corresponds to the IP~address~\textil{127.0.0.1}.
Basically, it means that we want to connect to the \postgresql\ \server\ running directly on the very machine in front of which we are sitting.%
%
\item After this, we could add a \pgls{port}.
Since we left the \pgls{port} \textil{5432} at the standard setting during the installation, we do not need to provide it.
We could write \textil{:5432} directly after \localhost, or replace \textil{5432} with whatever \pgls{port} at which the \postgresql\ \server\ is listening.%
%
\item If we would like to connect to a specific \db, say with the name~\textil{dbname} then we would then write \textil{/dbname}.
But we do not want to do this, because we did not create any \db\ yet.
So we do not specify any \db\ in the connection~\pgls{URI}.%
\end{itemize}%
%
Hence, as illustrated in \cref{fig:psqlNewUser2psqlOpen}, our connection~\pgls{URI} is \textil{postgres://postgres:XXX@localhost}.
The complete command to launch the \psql\ \client\ is thus \bashil{psql postgres://postgres:XXX@localhost}.
Once the \psql\ \pgls{terminal} is open, we can begin typing commands in the \sql~language.%
%
\noviceHint{%
Yes, we now use some \sql\ commands. %
You did not yet learn anything about \sql. %
Do not let that bother you too much. %
Most of these commands are relatively close to the natural English language. %
We will explain the commands and datatypes that we use while we are using them. %
Remember when we said \emph{learning by doing} at the beginning of~\cref{sec:simpleExampleIntro}? %
We really mean it. %
You can read more about \sql, for example, in~\cite{MS2001S1URLC,PGDG:PD:SC,SP2002STYSI2D,SPMP1998SI2TDDASVEI12T,T2018ISARD,ANSIX3135,DB2019HTTPS,ISO90751987,ISOIEC9707112023E}.%
}%
%
We want to create a new user for the \psql\ \server.
As username, we pick \inQuotes{boss}.
The password shall be \inQuotes{superboss123}.
Obviously, this is a very unsafe password.
The boss will have to change it as soon as possible.%
%
\begin{sloppypar}%
As illustrated in \cref{fig:psqlNewUser3command}, in order to create the new user with that password, we write \sqlil{CREATE USER boss WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'superboss123';}\sqlIdx{CREATE USER}.
The first part of the command, \sqlIdx{CREATE!USER}\sqlIdx{USER}\sqlil{CREATE USER xyz}, tells the \server\ to create a new user account under the name \textil{xyz}.
The second part, \sqlil{WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'abc'}\sqlIdx{WITH!ENCRYPTED PASSWORD}\sqlIdx{PASSWORD}\sqlIdx{ENCRYPTED}, tells the \server\ that the password \textil{abc} should be used for this user.%
\end{sloppypar}%
%
Passwords are always stored in an encrypted way anyway in \postgresql, but it never hurts to specify this clearly.
Maybe we want to run the same commands later on another \dbms\ where it is necessary to explicitly say that passwords shall be encrypted.
You can read more about \sql\ commands in the \postgresql\ reference~\cite{PGDG:PD:SC}.%
%
\bestPractice{keywords}{%
Keywords in \sql\ may always be written completely in uppercase~\cite{DB2019HTTPS:SC}. %
Well, technically, \sql\ keywords are not case sensitive, so \sqlilIdx{WHERE} and \sqlil{where} work the same. %
It is most important to be consistent in your casing, regardless whether you prefer upper- or lowercase~\cite{B2025DS:SBPASG}. %
Nevertheless, I prefer uppercase and the \postgresql\ documentation does so too~\cite{PGDG:PD}.%
}%
%
Anyway, we type in the command and hit~\keys{\enter}.
The command is executed successfully.
The system signals this to us with the output \sqlilIdx{CREATE ROLE}\sqlIdx{CREATE!ROLE} in \cref{fig:psqlNewUser4executed}.
\psql\ always signals success by typing the command back to us, and under \postgresql, \sqlilIdx{CREATE ROLE} and \sqlilIdx{CREATE USER} are (almost) the same.

But how can we confirm the user \inQuotes{boss} has really been created successfully?
How do we know that it exists now?
We can simply list all users.
You see, a fully-fledged relational \dbms\ stores all information in tables, not just the actual data, but also the names of databases, users, and tables themselves~(as we will learn later in \cref{sec:rdbms}).
The result of this is that we can access information about users in the same way as normal data -- via \sql\ queries.
OK, as said, you do not yet really know how that works, but for now, just bare with us.

In \postgresql, all users are stored in the table named~\sqlilIdx{pg\_catalog.pg\_user}.\footnote{%
On other \pglspl{dbms}, the users may be stored differently.}
So we can just query this table.
The \sql\sqlIdx{SELECT{\idxdots}FROM} command \sqlil{SELECT usename FROM pg_catalog.pg_user;} will list the value of the column \sqlilIdx{usename} for all rows in the table \sqlilIdx{pg\_catalog.pg\_user}.
We type it in \cref{fig:psqlNewUser5getUsers} and hit~\keys{\enter}.
If we had run this command \emph{before} creating the user, on a fresh \postgresql\ installation, it would only list the single user \textil{postgres}, i.e., the administrator of the whole \dbms.
But if we run it again now, \emph{after} creating the new user, it will also list~\textil{boss}.
You can see this in \cref{fig:psqlNewUser6gotUsers}.

We can now close this \psql\ session by typing~\sqlil{\\q}\sqlIdx{{\textbackslash}q} and hitting~\keys{\enter}.
As shown in \cref{fig:psqlNewUser7typeQuit}, this takes us back to our normal \pgls{OS} \pgls{terminal} shown in~\cref{fig:psqlNewUser8quit}.

Actually, there are two ways to use \psql:
We can either open an interactive session.
In such a session, we type in the \sql\ commands, execute them by pressing~\keys{\enter}, and then read their output.
After that, we can type in the next command, execute it, read its output, and so on.
Eventually, we quit by executing~\sqlil{\\q}\sqlIdx{{\textbackslash}q}.

The other way to use \psql\ is to simply tell it to open a session, execute all the commands in a file~(a so-called \emph{script}), and then to close the session.
This second way is illustrated in \cref{lst:factory:create_user,exec:factory:create_user}.
\Cref{lst:factory:create_user} is the \sql\ script with the commands to be executed.
As you can see, in this script, we first list all the existing users on the \dbms.
The only user existing right after the \postgresql\ installation should be~\sqlilIdx{postgres}.
So the output of that first command should be only this single value.
Then we create the new user via \sqlil{CREATE USER}\sqlIdx{CREATE!USER}.
The output of this command, if executed successfully, should be \sqlil{CREATE USER} printed back to us.
Then we query the existing users again, which now should return a table with two values, \sqlilIdx{postgres} and \sqlil{boss}.

The second listing, \cref{exec:factory:create_user}, is the captured output~(the so-called \pgls{stdout}) of this non-interactive, script-executing \psql\ session.
It contains exactly the text that we expect.
However, its first and last line are different.

The first line in output listings like \cref{exec:factory:create_user} is always marked with {\color{listing-tool-command}{dark red color}} and begins with {\color{listing-tool-command}\texttt{\$}}.
It contains the actual \psql\ execution parameters, which are explained in detail in \cref{tbl:psqlParams} and~\cite{PGDG:PD:P}.
The last line in the output listings is always marked with {\color{listing-tool-result}dark blue color} and begins with {\color{listing-tool-result}\texttt{\#}}.
It signifies the version of the software and the \pgls{exitCode}.
Notice that you can download the whole example and run exactly the commands~(the {\color{listing-tool-command}{red text}} after the {\color{listing-tool-command}\texttt{\$}}) from our repository \url{\databasesCodeRepo}.%
