A wide range of \pglspl{dbms} for \pglspl{rdb} exist.
A few we already mentioned before.%

\hsection{Open Source}%
A very big chunk of the \pglspl{rdb} in many scenarios is managed by open source \pglspl{dbms}.
These systems are available for free and their source code is readily available in the internet.
Large communities exist around them that can offer all kinds of advise.
This makes them very attractive for developers and users.
Several of these systems are around since the 1990s, so they are mature and tested products~\cite{C20245YOQ}.

\mysql\ is a \pgls{DBMS} for \pglspl {rdb}~\cite{WAM2002MRMDFTS,TA2024DDAMWPAM,BT2021HPM,RGS2021BTOTONAMDFPC,D2015LMAM}.
It was originally developed by Michael Widenius and David Axmark at the Swedish company \mysql~AB and released in 1996~\cite{C20245YOQ}.
It soon gained widespread use as part of the \lampStack, i.e., a system setup for web applications based on the \linux\ operating system, the Apache webserver, the \mysql\ database, and the server-side scripting language~PHP~\cite{C2022HAFTLS,H2020ULU2E}.
\mysql~AB was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008, which in turn was acquired by Oracle in 2010~\cite{C20245YOQ}.

After the acquisition by Oracle, some of the original developers of \mysql, including Michael Widenius, created a fork of \mysql:~\mariadb~\cite{R2014MM,B2019LTMEELFFSAA,D2015LMAM,AA2018QAWMV1ITSQ,AA2018QAWMV2IDQ}.

\postgresql~\cite{TA2024DDAMWPAM,FP2023LP,OH2017PUAR,B2024PELUYDW} is an object-relational \pgls{dbms}, meaning that it supports concepts from \pgls{OOP}, such as inheritance relationships between tables.
It also supports many additional types like \pgls{JSON} objects and geometric types.
\postgresql\ emerged from the POSTGRES project, the successor of the INGRES project at the University of Berkeley in California~\cite{C20245YOQ}.
It may be the most fully-featured of the existing open source \pgls{SQL} \pglspl{dbs}
