The goal of this course is to introduce databases.
However, this is a practical course.
So we will work on practical examples and create \inQuotes{real} \pglspl{db} on real \pglspl{dbms}.
Therefore, you will also need to install and use such software.
Luckily, as detailed in \cref{sec:software}, several excellent \pglspl{dbms} are available for free, as open source.

Before we get into the necessary installation and setup steps that we need to really learn about \pglspl{db}, we face a small problem:
Today, devices with many different \pgls{OS} are available.
For each \pgls{OS}, the installation steps and software availability may be different, so I cannot possibly cover them all.
Personally, I strongly recommend using \linux~\cite{T1999TLE,B2022ELATCL,H2022LML} for programming, work, and research.
If you are a student of computer science or any related field, then it is my personal opinion that you should get familiar with this operating system.
Maybe you could start with the very easy-to-use \ubuntu\ \linux~\cite{CN2020ULB,H2020ULU2E}.
Either way, in the following, I will try to provide examples and instructions for both \ubuntu\ and the commercial Microsoft \windows~\cite{B2023W1IO} \pgls{OS}.
