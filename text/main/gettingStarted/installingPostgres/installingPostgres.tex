For our course, we will use the open source \pgls{DBMS} \postgresql~\cite{TA2024DDAMWPAM,FP2023LP,OH2017PUAR,B2024PELUYDW}.
Here, we briefly discuss how to install it on your machine.
\postgresql\ consists of a client and a server application.
The server is the actual \pgls{DBMS}.
It manages the databases and stores and provides the data.
The client, \textil{psql}, allows you to conveniently connect to the server in a normal \pgls{terminal}.
We want to install both pieces of software.
You can find more information about this process at the \postgresql\ download page \url{https://www.postgresql.org/download}, but at least for some systems, I can provide a step-by-step guide here.%
